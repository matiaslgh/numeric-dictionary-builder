## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/matiaslgh/numeric-dictionary-builder/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the bug, open a [new issue](https://github.com/matiaslgh/numeric-dictionary-builder/issues/new).

Please pay attention to the following points while opening an issue.

#### Write detailed information
Detailed information is very helpful to understand an issue.

For example:
* How to reproduce the issue, step-by-step.
* The expected behavior (or what is wrong).
* The operating system.


### Pull Requests
Pull Requests are always welcome.

1. When you edit the code, please run `npm run test` and `npm run lint` to check the formatting of your code before you `git commit`.
2. This project uses eslint and prettier. If you configure them in your IDE, you are going to detect/prevent some style/conventions issues.
3. This project has been done with TDD and it must keep that way. This means that if you add a new feature you must create its tests. If you fix a bug, you should add the test case which cover that scenario. At the end, the coverage must be at 100%.
4. Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. It should include the relevant issue number, if applicable.
