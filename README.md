## Numeric Dictionary Builder
Script to build a dictionary file, with a list of numbers (with optional prefix/suffix).

## Motivation
The dictionary is useful to apply brute force. In my case, I was playing a little with [aircrack](http://aircrack-ng.org/) to crack WPA/2 WiFi passwords. Anyway, with [this version](https://github.com/matiaslgh/numeric-dictionary-builder/commit/d705353e2bee8e4db4b36468d037742b3849e2a5) was enough to create the dictionary, but I decided to write a nicer solution with TDD to have a project to show when it's required.
